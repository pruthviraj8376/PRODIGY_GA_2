# PRODIGY_GA_2
Used an pre-trained generative model called Stable diffusion to create images using text as prompt
##  How It Works: Text → Image with Neural Networks

1. **Text Encoding**: Converts the prompt into a numeric vector that the model understands.
2. **Diffusion Process**: Starts with random noise and step-by-step refines it into an image matching the prompt.
3. **Training**: The model was trained on millions of image-caption pairs to learn how to "visualize" words.

> Just like a painter turns imagination into art, these models turn text into pictures — using deep learning and mathematics.
